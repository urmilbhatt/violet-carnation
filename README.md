# Violet-Carnation - Volunteer Matching Platform

> Spring 2026 freeCodeCamp Cohort Project

A platform that connects volunteers with nonprofit organizations based on skills, interests, availability, and location.

## Project Spec

**The Problem:**  
People want to volunteer but don't know where to start. Nonprofits need help but struggle to find reliable volunteers.

**Our Solution:**  
A matching platform that makes finding the _right_ volunteer opportunity feel personal, not like a generic job board. Someone who loves animals sees animal-focused opportunities first. Someone available only on weekends can filter accordingly.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- Next.js (React)
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

**Backend:**

- FastAPI (Python)
- SQLite

**Tools:**

- GitHub Projects for task management
- Discord for team communication
