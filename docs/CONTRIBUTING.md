## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 20.x or higher
  - Check your version: `node --version`
  - Download: https://nodejs.org/

- **Python** 3.11 or higher
  - Check your version (Windows): `python --version` or `Get-Command python`
  - Check your version (Linux/Mac): `python --version`
  - Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/

- **Package Managers**
  - npm (comes with Node.js)
  - pip (comes with Python)

- **Code Editor** with ESLint support (VS Code recommended)

- **Git** 2.x or higher
  - Check your version: `git --version`

- **GitHub Account** with access to the repository

## Setup

### Frontend

1. **Clone the repository:**

Choose your preferred method:

**HTTPS (recommended for most users):**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nhcarrigan-spring-2026-cohort/violet-carnation.git
  cd violet-carnation
```

**SSH (if you have SSH keys configured):**

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:nhcarrigan-spring-2026-cohort/violet-carnation.git
  cd violet-carnation
```

**GitHub CLI (if you have gh installed):**

```bash
  gh repo clone nhcarrigan-spring-2026-cohort/violet-carnation
  cd violet-carnation
```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**

```bash
  cd client
  npm install
```

3. **Run the development server:**

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Frontend should now be running at http://localhost:3000

### Known Warnings

You may see this TypeScript warning in your editor:

```
Cannot find type definition file for 'estree'
```

This is harmless and doesn't affect functionality. You can:

- Ignore it (recommended)
- Or install types: `npm install --save-dev @types/estree`

### Backend

> **Note:** The frontend server should still be running. Open a new terminal for the backend.

1. **Create virtual environment:**

```bash
  cd api
  python3 -m venv .venv
```

(assumes you're at project root)

2. **Activate virtual environment:**

   **Linux/Mac:**

```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**

```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
```

You _should_ see `(.venv)` appear in your terminal prompt.

3. **Install backend dependencies:**

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run development server:**

**note** first time setup you should seed the database, you don't have to but it will make testing easier.
Skip down to "Seeding the Database" section below for instructions on how to do that, then come back here to run the
backend api.

```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
```

5. **Verify it's running:**

- API: http://localhost:8000
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs

Expected output:

```

  INFO:   Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
  INFO:   Started reloader process
  INFO:   Application startup complete.
```

**Note:** You may see a 404 for `/favicon.ico` - this is normal and can be ignored.

6. **Stop the server:**

Press `CTRL+C`

7. **Deactivate virtual environment:**

```bash
  deactivate
```

You should no longer see `(.venv)` in your terminal prompt.

### Verifying Your Virtual Environment

After activating, you should see `(.venv)` in your terminal prompt:

```bash
(.venv) user@machine:~/project/backend$
```

To verify the venv is active:

```bash
  which python3
```

**Should output:** `/path/to/your/project/backend/.venv/bin/python3`  
**If it shows:** `/usr/bin/python3` → venv is **NOT** active, run activate command again

### Seeding the Database

For first time setup use the following command to seed the database from the `api` folder, after running the above steps.

```bash
  python utils/populate_db.py
```

**note** if you get an error related to columns not existing, or changes, see the next section to drop the database

### Dropping the Database

If there are schema changes, the easiest thing to do is drop the database and re-seed it. You can do this with the following command from the `api` folder:

```bash
  python utils/drop_db.py
```

Then use the above populate db command to re-initialize the database and seed it with fake data.

## Project Structure

- :warning: Structure is being finalized. Current discussion: client/api at root vs api nested in client.
- This section will be updated once decided.

## Development Workflow

You can find the list of current issues for the project at https://github.com/orgs/nhcarrigan-spring-2026-cohort/projects/12/views/1

1. Check GitHub Issues for available tasks
2. Comment in discord (#violet-carnation) and assign yourself the issue to claim it
3. Create a branch following naming convention: 'feature/description'
4. Make your changes/updates following Code Guidelines
5. Commit with clear messages
6. Open a Pull Request

### Branch Naming

Please use descriptive branch names:

- Features: 'feature/volunteer-profile'
- Bugs: 'fix/login-error'
- Docs: 'docs/update-readme'

Keep them lowercase with hyphens.

### Pull Requests

1. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive, present-tense messages:

- :white_check_mark: Good: 'feat: add volunteer interest logic'
- :white_check_mark: Good: 'fix: resolve login redirect issue'
- :x: Bad: 'fixed: login'
- :x: Bad: 'update stuff' or 'changes'

2. **Push your branch** to GitHub:

```bash
  git add <file>
  git commit -m 'your: commit message'
  git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

3. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub:

- Give it a clear title
- Reference the issue number (e.g., "Closes #42")
- Briefly describe what changed and why

4. **Request review** either in Github or ask in discord

5. **Address feedback** if requested, then merge when approved

6. **Delete branch** when finished

## Code Guidelines

### Automated Tools

**Frontend (Next.js/React):**

- ESLint (ES7) configured - your editor will show warnings
- Prettier: Not configured (optional for team to add)
- Use 2-space indentation

**Backend (FastAPI/Python):**

- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Ruff recommended for linting with FastAPI (optional): `pip install ruff`
- Use 4-space indentation (Python standard)

### Naming Conventions

**Frontend:**

- Components: `PascalCase` (e.g. `VolunteerCard.tsx`)
- Utilities/helpers: `camelCase` (e.g. `formatDate.ts`)
- Folders: `lowercase-with-hyphens`

**Backend:**

- Python files: `snake_case` (e.g. `matching_service.py`)
- Follow FastAPI conventions for route structure

### Code Style

#### CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS

- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Keep styles close to components
- Avoid inline styles unless necessary
- Use descriptive class names for custom CSS

Example:

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-4 p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Volunteer Profile</h2>
</div>
```

#### Component/Function Naming

**Components:**

- Use descriptive names: `VolunteerProfileForm` not `Form2`
- One component per file

**Functions:**

- Name functions by what they do: `calculateMatchScore()` not `doThing()`

#### Comments

- Write comments for **why**, not **what**
- Complex logic = explain your thinking
- Don't comment obvious code

#### API Endpoints (FastAPI)

Follow RESTful conventions:

- `GET /volunteers` - list
- `GET /volunteers/{id}` - detail
- `POST /volunteers` - create
- `PUT /volunteers/{id}` - update
- `DELETE /volunteers/{id}` - delete

Use clear, plural nouns for resources.

#### Common Patterns

**Fetching data in React:**

```tsx
// Use descriptive names
const { data: volunteers, isLoading, error } = useVolunteers();

// Handle loading and error states
if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;
```

**FastAPI route example:**

```python
@router.get("/volunteers/{volunteer_id}")
async def get_volunteer(volunteer_id: int):
    """Retrieve a single volunteer by ID."""
    # Implementation
```
